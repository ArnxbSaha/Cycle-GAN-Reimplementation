# Cycle-GAN-Reimplementation
My attempt at re-implementing 'Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks', in Google Colab. 

The jupyter notebook has the complete code for the re-implementation, which accesses the datasets through google drive. It was experiemented on five different datasets, whose final '16' results are collected under the 'Results' folder, to give an glimpse of how the image-to-image translation came through.

The datasets are collected from 'https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/'.
